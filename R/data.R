#' @description The Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training
#' (HF-ACTION) study was conducted between 2003--2007 to investigate whether
#'adding exercise training to the usual care of heart failure patients improves their cardiovascular outcomes (O'Conner et al., 2009).
#' This dataset is for a high-risk subgroup consisting of 741 nonischemic patients with
#' baseline cardiopulmonary test duration less than or equal to 12 minutes
#' and analyze recurrent hospitalizations as well as overall survival.
